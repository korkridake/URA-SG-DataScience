## Resale Prices for Condos in Tiong Bahru

Hello Tiong Bahru folks,

I've built a simple Tableau to follow the evolution of rental prices for Private Properties in Tiong Bahru (six condos and walk-up apartments / SIT flats). Better view on laptop / desktop.

Data is from URA and goes from January 2018 to October 2022 (sorry November data is not yet available)
Long story short, it's hard to avoid the increase in rental (stating the obvious here!). All flats, no matter the size or the dwelling are increasing in prices (around 12-13%)

A few notes:

* Market is still very liquid in Tiong Bahru and there is no major decrease in number of transactions so far (but this may change this quarter)
* 3 bedrooms are the most common flats (making 47% of the rental this year)
* You can still find 3 Bedder below SGD5,000 in old condos such as Central Green (larger units but old facilities and no balcony)
* When it comes to price increase, 3 bedrooms in Twin Regency saw an increase of only 7% in rental while their neighbours at Highline Residences and Regency Suites saw a whopping 16% year-on-year increase. However this may change as price increase accelerates in Q4
* You are probably better off avoiding the 1 bedroom flats which have seen their prices increased by 18% in 2022 (also because only newer condos have 1 bedroom offering)

For walk-up apartments the analysis is much challenging as the rental price depends a lot on the renovation done. I did include the street names so you can have an overall feel but it's hard to have an apple to apple comparison. URA also doesn't provide much data (compared to condos).

If it can make you feel better: Paradoxically Tiong Bahru is not hit too badly compared to some other areas like Keppel Bay or River Valley which have seen much larger increase (also because they cater to a different crowd).
